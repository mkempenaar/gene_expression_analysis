# Preface {-}

This project aims to teach the whole process of analysing a dataset containing gene expression data measured with RNA-sequencing technique. The tools we will use to perform the analysis will be the statistical programming language `R` with its many libraries and the software package [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) to interact with R.

Instead of following the usual weekly deliverables and final assignment, this course is setup around performing your own research, based on published data and given a general guideline with a set of defined end-products. Furthermore, this whole course is done *individually*. Cooperating and discussing however with your fellow students and helping each other is desired/ expected.
