# Data Analysis and Visualization {#chapter-5}

At this point we have one or more sets of DEGs from our experiment. It might be just one set or it might be a large number of comparisons made with a set of DEGs per comparison and/ or results from multiple approaches (manual, packages). This chapter offers some guidance to visualize, summarize and - finally - connect some biological relevance to the results. **Browse this chapter first** before choosing the visualization(s) to make for your data! If your article contains relevant figures that you would like to try and reproduce (given that enough data is available) that can be done as well instead of the visualizations shown here. Note however that the Volcano plot described below **is** required.

## Volcano Plot {#volcano}

A volcano plot is often the first visualization of the data once the statistical tests are completed. This plot shows data for *all* genes and we highlight those genes that are considered DEG by using thresholds for both the (adjusted) p-value and a fold-change. Many articles describe values used for these thresholds in their methods section, otherwise a good default is 0.05 for the adjusted p-value and around 1.0 for the log-FC.

Here we use the `EnhancedVolcano` library that creates a `ggplot2` volcano plot as shown below. This is packaged in a function `deseq.volcano` just because we create two figures and only need to change the input data set and plot title. The resulting scatterplot places the `-log10(pvalue)` values on the y-axis and the log-FC on the x-axis. This often results in a plot representing a volcanic 'eruption' where the fold-change influences the spread and the significance the height. Coloring is done based on the thresholds (-log10(0.05) for the adjusted and log2(2) for the log-FC) as follows:

* (dark) gray: not significant; both the FC and adjusted p-value is below the thresholds.
* green: high FC, but adjusted p-value is below the threshold.
* blue: adjusted p-value indicates significance, but FC below the threshold
* red: significant DEG

You can adjust the `pCutoff` and `FCcutoff` values depending on your own requirements, see the elaborate [documentation and examples](https://github.com/kevinblighe/EnhancedVolcano) on GitHub.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(EnhancedVolcano)

## Simple function for plotting a Volcano plot, returns a ggplot object
deseq.volcano <- function(res, datasetName) {
  return(EnhancedVolcano(res, x = 'log2FoldChange', y = 'padj',
                         lab=rownames(res),
                         title = paste(datasetName, "trisomic vs disomic"),
                         subtitle = bquote(italic('FDR <= 0.05 and absolute FC >= 2')),
                         # Change text and icon sizes
                         labSize = 3, pointSize = 1.5, axisLabSize=10, titleLabSize=12,
                         subtitleLabSize=8, captionLabSize=10,
                         # Disable legend
                         legendPosition = "none",
                         # Set cutoffs
                         pCutoff = 0.05, FCcutoff = 2))
}

## Note: input data is the corrected DESeq2 output using the 'lfcShrink' function (see chapter 4)
deseq.volcano(res = res.ipsc.lfc, datasetName = "IPSC")
deseq.volcano(res = res.neuron.lfc, datasetName = "Neuron")
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Note that the most simplest case is:
EnhancedVolcano(res.ipsc, x = 'log2FoldChange', y = 'padj', lab = rownames(res.ipsc))
```

**Notes**:

* When you have used edgeR instead you need to change the names of the columns (i.e. `log2FoldChange` == `logFC` and `padj` == `FDR`) used in this example.
* In this example there are too many DEGs to annotate with their name in the plots. The `EnhancedVolcano` plot function has many options for annotating significant genes, see the linked manual for further information.
* This section has been rewritten to use the `EnhancedVolcano` function instead of creating a manual ggplot2 plot as can be seen [in the old version](https://bioinf.nl/~marcelk/theme07/chapter-5.html#volcano) of the course manual.


## Venn Diagram {#venn-diagram}

Another common visualization is a Venn-diagram. With our data set we've shown two comparisons; trisomic vs disomic in two cell types. Using a Venn-diagram we can show both the *shared* and *unique* DEGS for the *IPSC trisomic vs IPSC disomic* and *NEUR trisomic vs NEUR disomic* comparisons.

Creating a Venn-diagram can be a good method for selecting a (sub)set of DEGs, for instance by selecting the set of DEGs that are shared between groups (the *Intersection*, see the [Wikipedia page on Set Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory) or the other way around, only the DEGs that are unique for a group (the *Difference*). Keep this in mind when continuing on to the [clustering](#clustering) section below where it is most likely not useful to cluster all combinations you might have.

Code examples:

* Data preparation (first code-chunk): creating vectors of DEGs for both packages. These DEGs are the gene names (taken from the row names of each DEG-analysis).
  - The output of the DESeq2 `results` and `lfcShrink` functions are stored in the `res.ipsc.lfc` and `res.ipsc.neuron` objects.
* Using the `VennDiagram` library (second code-chunk): good for complex/ large number of comparison, highly configurable but more difficult to use. To see some examples, run the following function in the R console: `example('draw.quad.venn')`
* Using the `gplots` library (third code-chunk): Easier to use and support for complex Venn diagrams, but not good for adjusting appearance.

See the blog post "[VENN DIAGRAM WITH R OR RSTUDIO: A MILLION WAYS](https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/venn-diagram-with-r-or-rstudio-a-million-ways/)" for more methods of creating Venn diagrams.

```{r vennDataPrep}
## Data preparation
pval_threshold <- 0.05
ipsc.degs <- row.names(res.ipsc.lfc[which(res.ipsc.lfc$padj <= pval_threshold), ])
neur.degs <- row.names(res.neuron.lfc[which(res.neuron.lfc$padj <= pval_threshold), ])
```

The two created vectors of gene names can be used by either taking their lengths (for the `VennDiagram` library) or just their names (for the `gplots` library). 

```{r vennDiagram, fig.cap="Venn diagram comparing edgeR and DESeq2 DEGs using 'VennDiagram'"}
## Venn-diagram using the `VennDiagram` library (see below for alternative method)
library(VennDiagram)
# Arguments for a pairwise (two-sets) venn-diagram are sizes for set1, set2 and overlap (intersect)
# Many more functions are available for triple, quad and quantuple diagrams (starting with 'draw.***')
venn.plot <- draw.pairwise.venn(length(ipsc.degs),
                                length(neur.degs),
                                # Calculate the intersection of the two sets
                                length( intersect(ipsc.degs, neur.degs) ),
                                category = c("IPSC Trisomic vs Disomic", "NEURON Trisomic vs Disomic"), scaled = F,
                                fill = c("light blue", "pink"), alpha = rep(0.5, 2),
                                cat.pos = c(0, 0))

# Actually plot the plot
grid.draw(venn.plot)
```

As mentioned, following is an easier alternative (especially when you have > 2 groups) with the `venn` function from the `gplots` library. This only needs a list containing either the row-numbers or the gene-names of the DEGs which is easier (but offers less adjustability to make it prettier).

```{r alternativeVenn, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Venn diagram comparing edgeR and DESeq2 DEGs using 'gplots'"}
## Alternative method using the `gplots` library
library(gplots)
# Create a Venn-diagram given just the list of gene-names for both sets
venn(list("IPSC Trisomic vs Disomic" = ipsc.degs,
          "NEURON Trisomic vs Disomic" = neur.degs), )
```
While both analysis result in a similar amount of DEGS (849 for the IPSC and 769 for the Neuron cell types) only 96 DEGs are shared between both cell types and most are thus unique.

## Clustering {#clustering}

Here, we can create a heatmap of the found DEGs for all samples where the colors show the fold-change value. Usually this heatmap is shown with a two color gradient; from red (downregulated) to green (upregulated). This is however optional and using the default colors from `pheatmap` for example is perfectly fine as long as a proper legend is present.

There are multiple methods of creating a heatmap (one of which you've already used) and most of these directly apply clustering in the visualization. This clustering can be applied to the expression pattern of a gene (row-clustering), the expression pattern of a sample (column-clustering) or both (default for `pheatmap`).

The following example is  commonly found in publications as shows the log2 Fold Change values for the comparison that was done. The first and fifth columns show the log2(FC) as calculated by DESeq2 for the two trisomic vs disomic comparisons. The remaining columns are the log fold changes of the *separate* trisomic replicates vs the *average* disomic expression (manually calculating the Log(FC) as done in [section 4.1](#deg-fc) using the DESeq2 normalized count data from the `rld.dds` object). The DESeq2 calculated FC values show greater changes compared to the manually calculated FC values. The value in showing the manually calculated values too is to see if all replicates show the same patterns within groups. They are however optional *unless* you only have one comparison as you cannot create a heatmap with a single column.

Note that column-clustering has been turned off for this type of plot by setting `cluster_cols = FALSE` (all replicates are from the same group, clustering will not add any useful information).


```{r .heatmapDataPrepHidden, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
lfc.threshold <- 2
# Filter for pvalue and lFC thresholds
ipsc.degs.lfc <- rownames(res.ipsc.lfc[which( abs(res.ipsc.lfc$log2FoldChange) >= lfc.threshold &
                                                    res.ipsc.lfc$padj <= pval_threshold), ])

neur.degs.lfc <- rownames(res.neuron.lfc[which( abs(res.neuron.lfc$log2FoldChange) >= lfc.threshold &
                                                    res.neuron.lfc$padj <= pval_threshold), ])

genes <- intersect(ipsc.degs.lfc, neur.degs.lfc)

ipsc.selected.degs <- data.frame(DESeq2.IPSC=res.ipsc.lfc[genes, "log2FoldChange"])
ipsc.selected.degs$di_avg <- rowMeans(assay(rld.dds)[genes, di_IPSC])
ipsc.selected.degs <- cbind(ipsc.selected.degs, assay(rld.dds)[genes, tri_IPSC]-ipsc.selected.degs$di_avg)
ipsc.selected.degs <- ipsc.selected.degs[, -2]

neur.selected.degs <- data.frame(DESeq2.Neuron=res.neuron.lfc[genes, "log2FoldChange"])
neur.selected.degs$di_avg <- rowMeans(assay(rld.dds)[genes, di_NEUR])
neur.selected.degs <- cbind(neur.selected.degs, assay(rld.dds)[genes, tri_NEUR]-neur.selected.degs$di_avg)
neur.selected.degs <- neur.selected.degs[, -2]
```

```{r expressionHeatmap, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.cap="Heatmap showing the fold changes of the Trisomic vs Disomic comparisons for both cell types. The shown genes are all shared DEGS (the 96 shown in the Venn-diagrams) but also filtered for an absolute log2(FC) value of >2."}
# DEGs
heatmap.degs <- cbind(ipsc.selected.degs, neur.selected.degs)
cells <- data.frame(Cell=factor(rep(1:2, each=4), labels = c("IPSC", "Neuron")))
rownames(cells) <- names(heatmap.degs)
pheatmap(heatmap.degs, cluster_cols = FALSE,
         # Note: placing the 'Log2(FC)' label above the legend is tricky and optional
         legend_breaks = c(-7.5, -5, -2.5, 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 9), 
         legend_labels = c("-7.5,","-5,", "-2.5,", "0", "2.5", "5", "7.5", "Log2(FC)\n"),
         annotation_col = cells, fontsize_row = 7, 
         main="IPSC and Neuron shared DEGS with log2(FC) >= 2")
```

A limitation of a heatmap will show itself when more then 100 DEGs are found; this just doesn't fit well in a single figure and causes the clustering and especially the gene names/ labels to be unreadable. It is therefore always adviced to not only filter on the adjusted p-value, but also on the log-FC value to reduce the number of genes shown. Alternatively if the data is properly annotated, instead of showing gene names for each row, showing a GO-term clustering might reveal expression patterns for certain gene groups.

## Pathway Analysis {#pathway-analysis}

In some cases you'll see hundreds or even thousands of DEGs as a result of an analysis. These large amounts of DEGs are too much for most visualization approaches or to easily say something about the biological context for that many genes.

One approach for tackling such a large set of DEGs is *pathway analysis* where through different methods genes are grouped by pathway to get an overview of affected pathways in the experiment.

This section will demonstrate two methods for this analysis, one using an online platform for *gene-annotation enrichment* analysis and an R-method for *signaling pathway impact analysis*. 

### Gene Functional Classification using DAVID (>100 DEGs)

The online *Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery* [DAVID](https://david.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp) tool suite allows for multiple - functional - annotation methods, one of these can be used for enrichment analysis based on gene annotation. To use the DAVID tools we need to have the list of gene names, ID's or other identifyable information (no need for p-values or fold-changes). The basics of this method consist of grouping genes in pathways, count how many genes are in each pathway and compare this with what you would expect if you take a *random* sample from the genome with the same size as the number of your DEGs.

For example, if the **RNA transport** pathway contains a total of 50 genes out of the total of 25.000 for the whole mouse genome. This means **0.2%** of **all** mouse genes have a role in this pathway.

If you uploaded a total of 1000 DEGs for analysis, you expect 0.2% = **2** genes from your DEG list to be placed in this pathway. But, it seems that there are **10** genes from the **RNA transport** pathway in the set of 1000 genes, which is **5** times as much as expected. This difference between expected and observed gene counts per pathway allows to say if a particular pathway is *enriched*. 

DAVID provides a single interface to perform multiple different annotation pipelines, see the table below for available types and their use.

![*DAVID functional annotation methods*](chapters/images/DAVID_what_to_use.jpg)

The following example code writes the gene *symbols* for both analysis approaches to a file for upload on DAVID.

```{r writeDEGs, eval=FALSE}
# Write gene names to a file
write.table(edgeR.degs, file = "../data/edger-deg-names.txt",
            row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
write.table(DESeq.degs, file = "../data/deseq-deg-names.txt",
            row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
```

**Upload data**

Click on the *Start Analysis* button at the top of the DAVID website. Then, copy the genes (**A**) or upload the file (**B**) and select the proper identifier type (*OFFICIAL_GENE_SYMBOL* in this example). Select the *Gene List* option in *Step 3* and click on the *Submit List* button in *Step 4*. 

![*Start analysis by uploading gene information data*](chapters/images/DAVID_upload_gene_symbol.png)

This usually results in a popup that mentions that some of your IDs were found in multiple organisms. Close the popup and select your own organism (Mus musculus in this example) from the Species list. From the 940 uploaded gene-symbols, 881 were found in the mouse which we select followed by clicking on the *Select Species* button.

![*Select the source (organism) for the genes*](chapters/images/DAVID_select_organism.png)

The most useful analysis is the *Functional Annotation Chart*, selectable from the *Start Analysis* page after uploading the set of genes. The output table shows many (in this case ~560) *chart records* in which the genes were grouped. These records orginate from various sources, such as *GO-terms*, *Interpro*, *KEGG-pathways*, *SMART*, etc. See the image below for a quick explaination of what is displayed in such a chart (mostly just a table..).

![*DAVID functional annotation chart - Help*](chapters/images/DAVID_annotation_chart.jpg)

An interesting statistic to add to this table is the *Fold Enrichment* that shows how over- or under-represented this group is. Note that this is not based on *gene-expression* but only on the deviation of the of the amount of genes provided for a certain group from what is expected given the *total number* of uploaded gene IDs. 

![*DAVID functional annotation chart - Settings*](chapters/images/DAVID_chart_settings.png)

Now, looking at the article for a random example set  with GSE ID [GSE80128](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE80128), one of the conclusions mentions the following on their gene-in-research (*Igf2as*):

> It is suggested that Igf2as play a role in energy metabolism, the cell cycle, histone acetylation and muscle contraction pathways.

With almost a 1000 DEGs grouped in 560 different categories, you can find 'evidence' for most conclusions and the difficulty here is finding the *truly* important pathways. Adviced is to only check the KEGG-pathways listed in the table, sort by the corrected p-value and inspect the pathways that look interesting. For this example, amongst others, the following pathways were listed as significant (p-value < 0.05):

* *Metabolic pathways*: includes many pathways, 100 genes in total with a 1.6-fold enrichment
* *Citrate cycle (TCA)*: major metabolic pathway, 9 genes with a 5.7-fold enrichment
* *Cardiac Muscle contraction*: 12 genes with a 3.3-fold enrichment

Clicking on the *Term* in the table for a KEGG-pathway shows a graphical representation of this pathway indicating the found DEGs (blinking, even), see below.

![*KEGG TCA-pathway, highlighting DEGs (red stars)*](chapters/images/DAVID_TCA_pathway.png)

### KEGG-pathway Visualization (>10 DEGs)

Knowing the interesting KEGG-pathway(s) upfront (i.e. it is listed in the article) allows for visualizations applied to that selected pathway. For this we can use the `pathview` [website](https://pathview.uncc.edu) or Bioconductor [library](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/pathview.html):

> "... It maps and renders a wide variety of biological data on relevant pathway graphs. All users need is to supply their data and specify the target pathway. Pathview automatically downloads the pathway graph data, parses the data file, maps user data to the pathway, and render pathway graph with the mapped data."

This section demonstrates only the use of the bioconductor package for visualizing not only the DEGs onto pathways, but also the change in expression for each gene.

```{r pathview, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
## Bioconductor library (install with bioclite() if missing)
library(pathview)

## Example pathway IDs (for human, change organism key for other organisms)
data("paths.hsa")
pander(head(paths.hsa, n=5))

## Check 'gene.idtype' argument possibilities
data(gene.idtype.list); 
pander(gene.idtype.list)
```

```{r pathview_data_prep, eval=TRUE}
## Prepare data for visualization
deseq.degs.logfc <- subset(deseq.results, padj < pval_threshold, select = log2FoldChange)

pander(head(deseq.degs.logfc))
```

```{r pathview_vis, eval=FALSE}
pathview(gene.data=deseq.degs.logfc,
         pathway.id="00020", # TCA-cycle
         species="hsa"     # Organism key
)
```

It is fine to use the webtool too for this purpose however it is not notacibly easier to use than the R package.

### Signaling Pathway Impact Analysis (>20 DEGs) {#spia}

To also look at the *topology* of *how* genes interact with each other, we can use the [SPIA](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SPIA.html) Bioconductor package. This package takes a list of Entrez gene IDs for all DEGs and the complete list of Entrez IDs for all present genes and evaluates - per pathway - if genes are involved and if the pathway is either inhibited or activated. 

The code below uses data objects that were not always shown before, see the tables below for their contents.

```{r spia_data_load, echo=FALSE}
load("./data/annotated_ipsc_di_vs_tri.RData")
deseq.results <- ipsc.tri.vs.di
```

```{r spia_data_prep, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# Bioconductor package for "Signaling Pathway Impact Analysis"
# (install with biocLite("SPIA") if it is not installed)
library(SPIA)
# Only used for the `subset` function
library(dplyr)

# Get a vector of log(FC) values for all significant genes
sig_genes <- subset(deseq.results, padj < pval_threshold, select = log2FoldChange)[[1]]
# Make it a named vector by assigning the Entrez ID's to each log(FC) value
names(sig_genes) <- subset(deseq.results, padj < pval_threshold, select = EntrezID)[[1]]
# A complete list of Entrez IDs for all genes in this experiment
all_genes <- deseq.results$EntrezID
```

The input `sig_genes` named vector contents:
```{r spia_contents, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
idx = !is.na(names(sig_genes))
.sig.genes <- head(data.frame(EntrezID=names(sig_genes[idx]),
                              "logFC"=sig_genes[idx], 
                              row.names=NULL), n=10)

pander(.sig.genes, caption = "(subset) of DESeq2 DEGs with their Entrez ID and log2(FC) value")
```

And the `all_genes` vector or Entrez IDs input (note that this does not contain any expression information, just IDs):
```{r, eval=TRUE}
pander(all_genes[which(idx)[100:110]])
```

To start processing all pathways looking for influenced signal pathway, execute the `spia` function for the proper organism (Mus Musculus, or `mmu` in this case):

```{r spia_processing, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Process all signaling pathways to see if they are inhibited or activated
spia_result <- spia(de=sig_genes, all=all_genes, organism="hsa", plots=TRUE)
```

Running this function will print a list of (> 100) pathways it will analyze, so this will take a while:

```
Done pathway 1 : RNA transport..
Done pathway 2 : RNA degradation..
Done pathway 3 : PPAR signaling pathway..
Done pathway 4 : Fanconi anemia pathway..
Done pathway 5 : MAPK signaling pathway..
Done pathway 6 : ErbB signaling pathway..
Done pathway 7 : Calcium signaling pathway..
Done pathway 8 : Cytokine-cytokine receptor int..
Done pathway 9 : Chemokine signaling pathway..
Done pathway 10 : NF-kappa B signaling pathway..
Done pathway 11 : Phosphatidylinositol signaling..
Done pathway 12 : Neuroactive ligand-receptor in..
Done pathway 13 : Cell cycle..
...
Done pathway 132 : Graft-versus-host disease..
Done pathway 133 : Arrhythmogenic right ventricul..
Done pathway 134 : Dilated cardiomyopathy..
Done pathway 135 : Viral myocarditis..
```

The resulting data frame is ordered by a p-value and contains the following information:

```{r spia_result_table, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
load(file = "./data/spia.RData")
pander(head(spia_result[,1:11], n=5), caption = "Top signaling pathways ")
```

To get an overal picture we can create a plot where each pathway is a point which is placed according to the `spia` calculated over-representation p-value and pNDE (which is the probability to observe at least nDE genes on the pathway). In this case it is obvious that Alzheimer's and Parkinson's pathways with ID's 05010 and 05012 respectively are the most influenced by this experiment, according to this method.

```{r spiaResultPlotP, eval=TRUE, fig.cap="SPIA two-way evidence plot showing the most influenced pathways"}
plotP(spia_result)
```
